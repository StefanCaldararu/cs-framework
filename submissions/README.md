# Submissions
There are four submissions included as examples. Each of the submissions has seperate build features, demonstrating the capabilities. Hopefully, enough examples for building are included that other examples can be run, assuming the appropriate compilers are installed.
 
 > [!NOTE]
 > Specific documentation and examples which can be directly used are provided for python users to make usage of the system as easy as possible, as they may be unexperienced with `Makefile`s. For C and C++, it is assumed users know how to use `cmake`, and other build capabilities.

## Table of Contents

1. [Submission Requirements](#submission-requirements)
2. [Python Submission](#python-submission)
3. [C Submission](#c-submission)
4. [C++ Submission](#c++-submission)
5. [Java Submission](#java-submission)

## Submission Requirements
A file named `source_file.<extension>`, along with a `Makefile` must be submitted for each submission. Additionally, bash build scripts and other files (such as [cmake](https://github.com/StefanCaldararu/cs-framework/blob/main/submissions/c_submission/CMakeLists.txt)) can be included in the submission folder. the `Makefile` must be structured as follows:

```
build:
    <build instructions>
run:
    <run instructions>
clean:
    <cleanup instructions>
```
## Python Submission
### Building
The python submission uses `make build` to install the python dependancies via pip. A [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/StefanCaldararu/cs-framework/blob/main/submissions/python_submission/requirements.txt) file is included, which has the python dependancies. When using python, it is recomended that a clean python environment is used to test the code. If this is done, `pip freeze > requirements.txt` can be used to automatically generate a list of dependancies. When this is done, the `Makefile` can be directly copied for users submitting python code.

> [!NOTE]
> It is recomended that packages are installed via pip, even in an anaconda environment as this will ensure automatic generation of the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/StefanCaldararu/cs-framework/blob/main/submissions/python_submission/requirements.txt) is possible.

> [!NOTE]
> For this example, `Python 3.8.12` and `pip 23.3` are used.

### Running
The python file is directly run using `python3`.

### Cleaning
In this example, the conda environment is removed. This is not necessary, but good practice to provide a clean environment for other submissions
> [!NOTE]
> For more professional organizations, a completely new environment will likely be used, so this is unnecessary.

## C Submission
### Building
The c submission uses `cmake` to build the c executable. A [`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/StefanCaldararu/cs-framework/blob/main/submissions/c_submission/CMakeLists.txt) is included, as well as a [bash](https://github.com/StefanCaldararu/cs-framework/blob/main/submissions/c_submission/build.sh) script which builds the executable. `make build` runs this bash script.
> [!NOTE]
> For this example, `cmake 3.22.1` is used.

### Running
The executable generated by the build script is run.

### Cleaning
Cleanup involves removing the executable and the build folder.

## C++ Submission
### Building
The c++ submission is build similarly to the C submission, but additionally includes an external dependancy (TODO: need to test this works). This external dependancy is built from a provided bash script. Additionally, the external dependancy has it's own python dependancies, so these are installed via `pip` and a [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/StefanCaldararu/cs-framework/blob/main/submissions/cpp_submission/requirements.txt) file. 

### Running
The executable generated by the build script is run.

### Cleaning
Cleanup involves removing the executable and the build folder. TODO:!!!!
## Java Submission
### Building
The java submission is compiled and run through the [java sdk](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). This can be installed on an ubuntu system (the intended target system) via `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk`. `make build` compiles the java program using `javad`.

> [!Note]
> For this example, `openjdk 11.0.20.1` was used.

### Running
The executable is run via `java <executable>`

### Cleaning
The executable is removed.
